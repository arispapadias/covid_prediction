In this thesis, three different artificial neural networks were used to construct a deep learning application to forecast COVID-19 disease fatalities in Greece. The daily COVID-19 patient fatalities from 306 days of real data are used to train the neural networks. These artificial neural networks were created using deep learning methodologies and techniques, together with the architecture of RNN, Deep MLP, and LSTM RNN.

This thesis compares various deep learning techniques in order to determine which one is best for estimating COVID-19 disease-related fatalities.
