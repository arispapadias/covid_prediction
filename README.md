this thesis, a deep learning application was implemented to predict deaths from the COVID-19 disease in Greece, using three different artificial neural networks. The neural networks are trained with 306 days of real data containing the daily deaths of patients from COVID-19. The development of these artificial neural networks was based on the architecture of RNN, Deep MLP and LSTM RNN combined with the use of deep learn-ing techniques and methods.

The aim of this thesis is to compare and find the most suitable deep learning tech-nique for predicting deaths from the COVID-19 disease.
